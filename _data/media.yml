# Rules:
#
# # # # # # # # # # # #
#
#
#
# 1. Indentation matters big time in this file. Don't stray from the visual
# style I have set.
#
# 2. Indentation is NOT created with the `tab` key. Use 2 spaces for each level
# of indentation.
#
# 3. Hyphens indicate the start of a new set of values that are considered to be
#    one item. They must be placed inside the indented space as though they are
#    part of the indentation. So instead of indenting with `{ space }{ space }`,
#    you'd indent with `{ hypen }{ space }`. They can be optionally placed on their
#    own lines, but the indentation must still be the same. You'll see examples of
#    both below. Keeping them inline or giving them thier own line is a matter of
#    visual preference.
#
# 4. Use blank lines all you like for visual preference. But only between
#    values. Values cannot contain a return to a new line. If your value is really
#    long and automatically wraps to a new line without you hitting the return key,
#    that's fine.
#
# 5. Any values you enter containing a colon (:), pound sign (#) or comma (,)
#    must be completely wrapped in quotation marks ("value"). You can actually wrap
#    any value in quotation marks if you like.
#
#    Example: "Sisters of Swing: The Story of the Andrews Sisters"
#
#
#
# # # # # # # # # # # #
#
#    Actually using quotations marks that you want to be visible to visitors
#    gets tricky. I'd say avoid it if you can, but if you cannot... here are the
#    rest of the rules:
#
# # # # # # # # # # # #
#
#
#
# 6. If the value doesn't require being wrapped in quotation marks (because of
#    the fifth rule) AND the value doesn't START with a quotation mark, just use
#    them freely.
#
#        Example: "Sisters of Swing: The Story of the Andrews Sisters"
#        Visitors will see: 
#           Sisters of Swing: The Story of the Andrews Sisters
#
# 7. If you need to start with a quotation mark or you already needed to wrap
#    your value in quotation marks (because of the fifth rule) you must put a
#    backslash (\) directly before each inner quoation mark.
#
#        Example: "Sisters of Swing: The \"Story\" of the Andrews Sisters"
#        Visitors will see: 
#           Sisters of Swing: The "Story" of the Andrews Sisters
